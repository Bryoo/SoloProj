# Dojo Room Allocation

## Problem Description

When a new Fellow joins Andela they are assigned an office space and an optional living space
if they choose to opt in. When a new Staff joins they are assigned an office space only.
In this exercise you will be required to digitize and randomize a room allocation system for one of Andela Kenyaâ€™s facilities called The Dojo.

*The header above is "H2" size. The headers below will range from "H2" to "H4" depending on the number of hashtags in front of them*

## Usage

```
$ python interact.py -i

```
```create_room (living|office) <room_name>...```
This creates new rooms by taking in parameters of the type of room and name.
One can create multiple rooms by specifying multiple room names.

```add_person <fname> <lname> (fellow [[yes|y][y|n]] | staff)```
Adds a person to the system and allocates the person to a random room.
If there are no rooms, the person is added to the waiting list.
Only fellows are allocated rooms.

```print_room (office | living) <room_name>...```
Prints  the names of all the people in room_name on the screen.

```print_allocations [--o=filename]...```
Prints a list of allocations onto the screen. Specifying the optional -o option here outputs the registered allocations to a txt file.

```print_unallocated [--o=filename]...```
Prints a list of unallocated people to the screen.
Specifying the -o option here outputs the information to the txt file provided.
